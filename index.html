    <code><b>Inception</b> is about Dom Cobb, a thief who steals secrets by entering people's dreams, hired for the nearly impossible task of inception: planting an idea in a CEO's mind instead of stealing one, to prevent a corporate takeover, offering him a chance to return home to his children. He assembles a team (Arthur, Eames, Yusuf, Ariadne) to navigate multi-layered dreams, but Cobb's own subconscious projections of his dead wife, Mal, constantly sabotage the mission, blurring reality and forcing him to confront his past as they delve deeper into the subconscious. </code>

    <code> <b>Interstellar</b> is about ex-NASA pilot Cooper leading a mission through a wormhole near Saturn to find a new habitable planet for humanity, as Earth faces extinction from blight and famine, exploring themes of love, time dilation near a black hole, and human survival through sacrifice and connection. Cooper must navigate relativistic time, leaving his daughter Murph behind, only to realize future humans created the wormhole to guide him to a five-dimensional tesseract, allowing him to send critical data (gravity equations) back to Murph as a child to save humanity, ultimately finding his way back to a future version of his daughter. </code>
